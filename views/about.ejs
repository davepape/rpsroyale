    RPSRoyale is an online, massively multiplayer, battle royale version of Rock-Paper-Scissors.
<br><br>
    Matches happen asynchronously - you can attack any other player at any time.  Each player can queue one or more "defense" moves.  When you attack, your opponent's next defense move is used automatically.
<br><br>
    Each attack or defense costs one "action point"; when you run out, you can't do anything more.  You receive more action points every hour, but you can also get more by visiting Infringement Festival sites and scanning QR codes posted there.  If you want to be able to play more, visit more Infringement shows!
<br><br>
    Note: this is a first beta-test of RPSRoyale.  The exact rules could change at any time.
